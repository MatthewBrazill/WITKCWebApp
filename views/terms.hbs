        <h3>Waiver And Severability</h3>

        <p>
            No waiver by the Club of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing
            waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Club to
            assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <p>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
            illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent
            such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
